          1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            The full form of DOM is Document Object Model. It is a programming interface system for web documentation.
            It
            allows dynamical access and manipulate of the content, structure of web page. It is used to widely in
            JavaScript programming to create dynamic, interactive web applications. <br>
            The main purpose of DOM is to provide a structured representation of web document that can be accessed and
            control over dynamically. DOM represents as a tree-like structure, and every node in the tree corresponds an
            element, attribute, or piece of text in the web document. By accessing the power of modifying the properties
            and methods of these nodes, developers can change the style, behavior, and content of the web page in
            real-time. It helps web developers to create interactive web pages in response to user actions. These user
            actions are called events in this system. By handling these events we can make user experience better.

          2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            To select HTML elements using DOM, we can use various DOM methods and some most commonly used methods are:
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            i. getElementById(): This method select and returns element having a specific ID. <br>
            ii. getElementsByTagName(): This method select and returns a collection of elements having specific html tag
            name. <br>
            iii. getElementsByClassName(): This method select and returns a collection of elements having same class
            name. <br>
            iv. querySelector(): This method returns the first element that matches the specific CSS selector. <br>
            v. querySelectorAll(): This method returns a list of all elements that match the specified CSS selector.
            <br>

          3. What is event bubble?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Event bubble is a special method of the Document Object Model (DOM). It helps events to propagate or bubble
            up
            from the target element to its ancestors in the DOM tree until it reach to the root of the document. In this
            technique an event is triggered on an element and it can also trigger on all of its parent elements, unless
            one of the parent elements stops the propagation of the event. Event bubbling is important as it allows us
            to
            get access to the parent events of the DOM architecture of a web page. By this we can easily access, modify
            efficiently higher level elements. Besides, to stop unnecessary propagation we can use
            "stopImmediatePropagation()" or "stopPropagation()" method.

          4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            In JavaScript callback function an unique function which is passed as an argument in another function. This
            callback function is called inside the higher level or parent function and execute after the execution of
            the
            parent function. callback functions are mostly used in the event-driven programming like JavaScript to
            handle
            asynchronous programming. Usually to make an asynchronous request on a server using an object, we can
            provide
            a callback function to be executed when the server responds with object data.
